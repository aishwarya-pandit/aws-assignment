- npm init //package.json created

















Facts:
- .md stands for Markdown documentation.

- clear node-module and package-lock and run npm install in docker //script is there for the same
- at ssh server every time we install any new package we do npm i which creates new package-lock.json on server.
-Wildcards in package (major.minor.patch)
- ^ (caret). Which means that changes are allowed up to the MINOR part.
- ~ (tilde)allow only PATCH segment changes









Doubts:
- should we use nconf in case of docker deployment.. as here we do not have env specific files and env specific files in case ssh deployments.
